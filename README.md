# INTQuant-Case-Study
Results of group work on INTQuant Intensive Programme Case study.

The task was to calculate Risk-Weighted Assets using the Internal Model approach for three counterparties. The calculation of the Risk-Weighted Assets for the Bank requires the calculation of two important variables first: the Probability of Default (PD) for each of the counterparties, and the calculation of the Exposure At Default (EAD).
To proceed with the analysis of the exercise we used the programming language Python, with the application of many various libraries, and MS Excel.
